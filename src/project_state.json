  "architectural_notes": [
    "Remove Internet Identity authentication flow; app should function without sign-in.",
    "Do not persist user history in backend; any state (if present) should be non-authenticated/non-persistent per user requirement.",

    "Prediction should be based on the last 20 Big/Small results provided by the user (no other data source specified).",
    "Prediction logic should attempt automatic pattern/trend detection (including potential manipulation) rather than relying only on simple heuristics.",
    "When history length reaches 20, require an explicit user tap on a \"Next\" button (shown only at full capacity) to unlock the next Big/Small input; upon adding the next entry, remove the oldest item and shift indices so the new entry becomes #20.",
